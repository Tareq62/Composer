Encouraged by his grandfather, he began teaching himself guitar and songwriting as a teenager, then began recording his first albums in the United Action for Youth studio. Piano and guitar would continue to provide his primary compositional outlets for years to come.</p>

His four-movement composition <i>Seasonal</i> and other works of chamber music were performed by student ensembles in venues including Columbia's Miller Theatre.
