<br><b>Making a song and dance about Silicon Valley’s ethics</b>
<br>"This plotline echoed much of my own life, and I felt like a love-struck New York gang member hearing about West Side Story."

<br><b>Funny tech troubles click in ‘South of Market: The Musical’</b>
<br>"The closing number of 'South of Market: The Musical V2' is a tune called 'Believe In Yourself (But Not Too Much).' It perfectly sums up the spirit of this sassy, DIY production poking fun at the tech industry and the hubris and fears of the many young people in it."

<br><b>Silicon Valley stereotypes meet musical in 'South of Market'</b>
<br>"The show does hint at weightier themes, like some companies paying lip service, but not much more, to equal pay. Then there's the song 'All the Feelings,' which runs through the pat Facebook reactions available in a complex world of political turmoil and natural disasters: 'like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry,' the chorus goes.
<br>'Part of the premise of that song is that these six reactions... are supposed to be sufficient to interact with the news we're seeing about the world today,' says Tareq Abuissa, who wrote the music and lyrics. 'There's irony there that they can't actually capture what we're observing.'"

<br><b>'South Of Market: The Musical' Serves Up Tech Industry Tropes With A Side Of Self Reflection</b>
<br>"If you’re a fan of HBO’s Silicon Valley, this is it on steroids —- with a soundtrack that ranges from uplifting to insane. What it loses in subtlety it makes up for by unabashed startup fervour; the stories may be ridiculous, but many of the people working at these companies really do believe they’re changing the world."

<br><b>Tech & show tunes! SOMA musical skewers Silicon Valley</b>
<br>"It seems appropriate that this whole game – startups doing a song and dance for the funders – should be set to music, and the score here by Tareq Abuissa is appropriately bright and bouncy, a pop/showtune blend with abundant humor. And the aforementioned band is absolutely terrific. Abuissa is on bass and serves as musical director, and though the whole band is terrific, the superstar is violinist Ishtar Hernandez, who lends a distinctive and cheerful sound."

<br><b>‘South of Market: The Musical’ parodies tech world</b>
<br>"Alongside the jargon-filled meetings and 'Silicon Valley' similarities is a score by Blute, O’Keefe and composer Tareq Abuissa with jazz, power ballads and show tunes.
<br>'We’ve searched for where the two worlds intersect in every musical number,' says Blute, who maintains there are commonalities between the seemingly incongruous worlds of tech and musicals. 'Tech and arts both have a passion for trying new things,' says Blute. Both focus on 'building [things] fast and innovating and engaging with their audiences or customers.'"

<br><b>Core Conditioning: The 118th Annual Varsity Show</b>
<br>"When writing a show for an audience that consists of Columbia’s entire undergraduate population, basing the plot around the Core seems like choosing the easy route... [yet V118] goes above and beyond; questioning and criticizing Columbia as opposed to merely parodying her. V118 takes a smartly written plot and executes it with passion and gusto, giving all of us a chance to self-deprecate and still leave with our pride intact."
