With his birthday fast approaching, Riley must maneuver a quick-to-judge venture capitalist who just ‘wants to be helpful,’ convince his CTO Anish to code instead of eating truffles in Dolores Park, and learn how to respect his COO, Delia, the backbone of their company.

<h2 class="video-heading">"Oh, the Sugars" <span>October 2013</span></h2>

Ben Crouse wrote and directed this "comic visual poem" which I scored with recorder, cello, piano, vocals, and triangle. He released it with Grossbus Animation on his birthday, a day before my own.

<h2 class="video-heading"><i>Seasonal: i-iii.</i> <span>April 2013</span></h2>

These three movements of chamber music were composed between September 2009 and April 2013, with each movement (fall, winter, spring) conceived during its corresponding season. I conducted this premiere, performed by Columbia ensemble LyricLion (flute, French horn, bassoon, 2 violins, 2 celli) joined by Juilliard harpist Katherine Siochi. See below for the fourth movement, premiered at a later performance.

<h2 class="video-heading">TEDxColumbiaCollege <span>November 2012</span></h2>

I created this looping cello and guitar performance using Ableton Live. The melody is from the third movement of <i>Seasonal</i>, while the live looping technique was inspired by Andrew Bird. The looping begins at <a id="time4">1:17</a>.

<h2 class="video-heading"><i>V118: The Corporate Core</i> <span>May 2012</span></h2>

The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Show" target="blank">Varsity Show</a> is Columbia's oldest performing arts tradition, with composer-lyricist alumni including Rodgers, Hammerstein, Hart, Kitt, and Yorkey. In its 118th annual installment, our spring satire on the year's memorable moments attracted an audience of over 5,000. Solomon Hoffman and I devoted our sophomore springs co-composing the two-act score for 11 singers and a pit of 25 musicians. For plot information, click to visit <a href="http://www.thevarsityshow.com/v118/">our year's Varsity Show page</a>. My favorite tunes begin at the following times:

<p><a id="time1">0:54</a> Another Epic Day!</p>
<p><a id="time2">43:36</a> Nothing But Love</p>
<p><a id="time3">57:55</a> Alma's Army</p>
