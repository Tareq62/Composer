<h2 class="video-heading">Juniper <span>May 2015</span></h2> 
Acoustic guitar, four-part humming harmonies, bass, and percussive tapping. Performed live and recorded on Mother's Day 2015 on my rooftop in Harlem. Composed on the guitar in drop-D tuning, including experiments in a 5/4 meter and modulation in the middle section. Harmony and sonic texture influenced by Grizzly Bear.

<h2 class="video-heading">Seasonal iv. No Ears <span>February 2014</span></h2>

My longest-running project, this fourth movement was composed for LyricLion to complete the April 2013 performance. Each movement's themes were conceived during the corresponding season. Solomon Hoffman conducted this premiere, performed by Columbia ensemble LyricLion joined by harpist Ellie Kirk. Claude Debussy has influenced my chamber composing most, and an orchestral treatment with a fourth movement is in progress.

<h2 class="video-heading">Lincoln Center: Spotlight On... &amp; Rapid Fire series <span>July 2013</span></h2>

I composed, recorded, and performed all instruments on the soundtracks for Lincoln Center's new artist interview web series. As a summer intern as the video portal was developing, my musical editing style helped shape the series' tones. I also did all video editing for the content with Joshua Bell, Claire Chase, and Iv√°n Fischer in Final Cut Pro, working closely with and learning from a resident professional video editor.

<h2 class="video-heading">Seasonal <span>April 2013</span></h2>

My longest-running project, these three movements were composed between September 2009 and April 2013. Each movement's themes were conceived during the corresponding season. I conducted this premiere, performed by Columbia ensemble LyricLion joined by Juilliard harpist Katherine Siochi. Claude Debussy has influenced my chamber composing most, and an orchestral treatment with a fourth movement is in progress.

<h2 class="video-heading">TEDxColumbiaCollege <span>November 2012</span></h2>

I created this looping cello and guitar performance using Ableton Live. The rendition of the third movement of Seasonal was influenced by Andrew Bird's looping technique. The looping texture begins at <a id="time4">1:17</a>.

<h2 class="video-heading">V118: The Corporate Core <span>May 2012</span></h2>

The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Show" target="blank">Varsity Show</a> is Columbia's oldest performing arts tradition, with composer-lyricist alumni including Rodgers, Hammerstein, Hart, Kitt and Yorkey. In its 118th annual installment, our spring satire on the year's memorable moments attracted an audience of over 5,000. Solomon Hoffman and I devoted our sophomore springs co-composing the two-act score for 11 singers and a pit of 25 musicians. For plot information, visit <a ref="http://www.thevarsityshow.com/v118/">our year's page</a>. My favorite songs begin at the following times:</p>
        <p><a id="time1">0:54</a> Another Epic Day!</p>
        <p><a id="time2">43:36</a> Nothing But Love</p>
        <p><a id="time3">57:55</a> Alma's Army</p>
